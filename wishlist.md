If you ever find yourself wondering, "I wonder what Lars would like for a gift?", you can look [here] for some ideas. There are cheap items and expensive items, there are silly items and serious items, and I absolutely do not expect anyone to use this list so please feel free to ignore this and do whatever you want :).
